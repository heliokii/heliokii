💫 **about me**

hey, i'm elijah (or just heliokii — pick whichever hurts less to type).  
i'm currently in quezon province pretending i understand operating systems while surviving on original nescafe 3in1 and creatine monohydrates.  

i write code that sometimes works. when it doesn't, it's obviously a feature.  
my specialties include: over-engineering to-do lists, debugging at 2 a.m., and collecting 47 tabs about "rust vs go 2026".

currently grinding fundamentals in january because new year = new me (lies).

if my commits look cursed at 3am, no you didn't see that. that was future me. present me has plausible deniability.

welcome to my digital mess — bugs compile eventually ✨

💻 **tech i'm wrestling with right now**

- python (comfort zone)  
- java (forced to love it for the sake of CS 211)  
- c/c++ (i understand pointers)  
- a little rust (i'm scared but intrigued)  
- html/css/js when i pretend to be frontend
